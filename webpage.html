		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>Born and brought up in the city of Chicago, I have had the most amazing
		experiences in life. Being and Indian living in America, I have learned to integrate
		both cultures in the most unique ways. I currently study at Illinois Institute of
		Technology and I am doing my third year there. I am also a professional Carnatic
		Musician and I have been giving performances in USA and India for the past 4 years.
		I run a successful blog and I am a part of Chicago Academy of Indian Fine Arts (a non
		profit organization interested in promoting Indian fine arts for an affordable price).</p>
		
		<h3>Academics</h3>
		<p>I am pursuing my bachelors in Digital Humanities with a minor in Computer Science.
		I had a wild ride with academics. I started off at Benedictine University with Pharmacy
		school. After one year of horrible chemistry, I transferred to IIT and changed my major
		to Computer Science. Two years of CS and Ireally could not program much anymore. After
		a lot of research, I decided to switch over to Digital Humanities. I had enough credits
		to have a minor in computer science.</p>

		<h3>Music</h3>
		<p>I have been learning Carnatic Music for the past 14 years. I did my arangetram
		in 2011 here in Chicago. After that, I started performing in various states here.
		After starting college, I started performing for the Margazhi Season.  Check out
		my website for more information!</p>
		
		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>I run a successful blog called Anugraha, where I discuss Indian culture. I try to keep
		a very open mind about my culture and hence I tend to ask questions that most would avoid.
		Thses questions have given me the most interesting stories. Apart from blogging, I am a
		swimmer and a huge Harry Potter fan.</p>
