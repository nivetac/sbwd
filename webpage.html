      <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
      <p>Born and brought up in the city of Chicago, I have had the most amazing
      experiences in life. Being and Indian living in America, I have learned to integrate
      both cultures in the most unique ways. I currently study at Illinois Institute of
      Technology and I am doing my third year there. I am also a professional Carnatic
      Musician and I have been giving performances in USA and India for the past 4 years.
      I run a successful blog and I am a part of Chicago Academy of Indian Fine Arts (a non
      profit organization interested in promoting Indian fine arts for an affordable price).</p>
      
      <h3 id="academics">Academics</h3>
      <p>I am pursuing my bachelors in Digital Humanities with a minor in Computer Science.
      I had a wild ride with academics. I started off at Benedictine University with Pharmacy
      school. After one year of horrible chemistry, I transferred to IIT and changed my major
      to Computer Science. Two years of CS and Ireally could not program much anymore. After
      a lot of research, I decided to switch over to Digital Humanities. I had enough credits
      to have a minor in computer science.</p>

      <h3 id="music">Music</h3>
      <p>I have been learning Carnatic Music for the past 14 years. I did my arangetram
      in 2011 here in Chicago. After that, I started performing in various states here.
      After starting college, I started performing for the Margazhi Season.  Check out
      my <a href="http://www.nivetachandrasekar.com">website</a> for more information!</p>
      
      <h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>
      <p>I run a successful blog called Anugraha, where I discuss Indian culture. I try to keep
      a very open mind about my culture and hence I tend to ask questions that most would avoid.
      Thses questions have given me the most interesting stories. Apart from blogging, I am a
      swimmer and a huge Harry Potter fan.</p>
